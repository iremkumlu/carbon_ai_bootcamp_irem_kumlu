This, though, raises the practical but important question of how to repair walls dented by holes left after hanging. "Small nails are your best friend – they're easy to patch up with spackling paste when it’s time to move out," says Cathy Glazer, founder of Artfully Walls, a curated site for art-buyers in the UK and US. "Lightweight pieces can be hung with thin nails and hooks from a basic picture-hanging kit. Most standard picture-hangers hold up to 30lbs. It's easier still to lean art on ledges or on stacks of books, mantelpieces or consoles for a very casual look."

Of course, when art is added to a home, it must coexist with furniture and homeware accumulated over time. Yet it needn't vie for attention with existing elements or get visually lost among them – it can be artfully displayed adjacent to homeware with similar qualities, for example echoing the bold, colourful pattern in a rug or the sensual curves of ceramics. And it can be shown with ephemera – from postcards to family snaps – to create aesthetically pleasing juxtapositions.
